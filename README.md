This is a C# MathNet.Numerics reimplementation of the Finite Element Method
two-dimensional examples showed in the first two chapters of the book [[1]](#1).

The aim of this project is to understand the absolute basics of the Finite Element method
through the implementation of it.

For the purposes of course work for KIV/VSS 2023.
